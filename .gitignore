# Cocoapods recommends against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. See
# http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-ignore-the-pods-directory-in-source-control

# Since Firebase is building libraries, not apps, we should not check in Pods.
# Pods are only used in the Examples and tests and doing a 'pod install' better
# matches our customers' environments.
#
# Note: if you ignore the Pods directory, make sure to uncomment
# `pod install` in .travis.yml
